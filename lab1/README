Welcome to the lab1: process management.

You will find in this directory all the needed files
and links for the lab. Your work consists of completing
programs so that they work.

simplefork.c : this is a basic fork program to get familiar
 with, do not forget the wait, introduction assignment.

 modify this server so that it can accept several connections
 at the same time. You will then discover that zombies are
 generated, consuming resources, which will prevent connections
 after a while. You will have then to solve this problem.
